# GeoNAN

GeoNAN is a lightweight geospatial data server written in .NET using [Nancy](http://www.nancyfx.org/). By using Nancy the desire is to support running GeoNAN on [Mono](http://mono-project.com). The goal of GeoNAN is to be simple to use and reduce the technical and financial cost compared to other geospatail data servers.
